# Explore and Summarize Data: Prosper Loans

In this project I perform an exploratory data analysis of a public data set containing 114K observations about [Prosper](prosper.com) Loans between Nov 2005 and Mar 2014.

## Summary

Using the [R](r-project.org) programming language with the [RStudio](rstudio.com) IDE and some R packages (dplyr, memisc, ggplot2 and gridExtra), I applied Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques in order to obtain insights from the data.

## Files

* **EDAproject.Rmd**: The R markdown document with the analysis and R code.
* **EDAproject.html**: The html file knit by RStudio.
* **prosperLoanData.csv**: A random sample of the data used in the analysis. The actual file is 86MB and is not included in this repo.
